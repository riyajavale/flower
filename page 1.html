<p align="center">Passiflora caerulea is a woody vine capable of growing to 25 metres (82 ft) high where supporting trees are available. <br>The leaves are alternate, palmately five-lobed (sometimes three, seven, or nine lobes), <br>and are up to 10 centimetres (3.9 in) in length while being linear-oblong shaped.<br>The base of each leaf has a flagellate-twining tendril 5–10 centimetres (2.0–3.9 in) long, which twines around supporting vegetation to hold the plant up.<br>

Generative characteristics
The flower is complex, about 10 centimetres (3.9 in) in diameter, with the five sepals and petals similar in appearance,<br> whitish in colour, surmounted by a corona of blue or violet filaments, then five greenish-yellow stamens and three purple stigmas.<br> The fruit is an oval orange-yellow berry, 6 centimetres (2.4 in) long by 4 centimetres (1.6 in) in diameter, containing numerous seeds. <br>It is edible to humans when ripe, but tends to have an undesirable flavour unless allowed to fully ripen in a warm climate and fall naturally from the vine,<br> when it has a mild blackberry flavour, though with a lower sugar content than commonly eaten species.</p>

<p align="center">American lotus is an emergent aquatic plant. It grows in lakes and swamps, as well as areas subject to flooding.<br> The roots are anchored in the mud, but the leaves and flowers emerge above the water's surface.<br> T The petioles of the leaves may extend as much as 2 m (6.6 ft) and end in a round leaf blade 33–43 cm (13–17 in) in diameter. <br> TMature plants range in height from 0.8 to 1.5 m (2.6 to 4.9 ft).<br> T

Flowering begins in late spring and may continue into the summer. <br> TThe specific name means "yellow" in Latin and refers to the flowers, which may be white to pale yellow.<br> T The flowers measure 18–28 cm (7.1–11.0 in) in diameter and have 22-25 petals.</p>

<p align="center">Amaryllis (/ˌæməˈrɪlɪs/)is the only genus in the subtribe Amaryllidinae (tribe Amaryllideae).<br> It is a small genus of flowering bulbs, with two species. <br>The better known of the two, Amaryllis belladonna, is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa,<br> particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley and Knysna.<br>

For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names Amaryllis and Hippeastrum,<br> one result of which is that the common name 'amaryllis' is mainly used for cultivars of the genus Hippeastrum, <br>widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors.<br>

Plants of the genus Amaryllis are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or,<br> in South March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. <br>This is one of numerous genera with the common name 'lily' due to their flower shape and growth habit.<br> However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, Lilium.<br> In the Victorian language of flowers, amaryllis means "love, beauty, and determination.</p>
